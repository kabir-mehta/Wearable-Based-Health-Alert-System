Developed a Machine Learning model that continuously monitors health parameters from a wearable device and generates alerts when it detects abnormal patterns, potentially indicating a health risk.
The final model is capable of predicting which disease a person might be diagnosed with, based on the symptoms.
Used various Supervised Learning algorithms including SVM, Decision Trees & Random Forest for prediction, achieving over 95% accuracy.
